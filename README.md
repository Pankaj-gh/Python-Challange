# Python-Challange
Python HW-3


There are two main folders in this exercise. PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains 2 folders and 1 file. The two folders are named Analysis and Resources respectively. The Resources folder contains the csv file and the Analysis folder contains the .txt file. The python script is called main.py and it is at the same level as the Resources and Analysis folders in PyBank and PyPoll.
 There are two Data Sets.
1) PyBank
2) PyPoll

PyBank  gives  details of profit/loss over a particular month and year. 
My analysis explored the data and calculated the following statistics.
1) Total Months 
2)Total Amount
3) Average Change
4)Greatest Increase in Profits 
5) Greatest Decrease in Profits 
 
  
Pypoll database gives information about the Candidates and their counties. Based on this information we need to calculate the total number of votes casted, percentage of votes per candidate and the winner of the poll. 
Similarly like the PyBank, the PyPoll results are also exported to a .txt file in the analysis folder.
